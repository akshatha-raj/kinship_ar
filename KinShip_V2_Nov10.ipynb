Make sure he has access to fresh water at all times to encourage urination and help flush out the urinary tract. It\\'s important to avoid giving him any over-the-counter medications without veterinary guidance. Additionally, try to prevent him from licking the affected area, as this can lead to further irritation.\n",

However, specific dietary changes to manage the UTI will depend on the severity and your dog\\'s individual needs. Once we have the urinalysis results, we can discuss any necessary dietary adjustments or supplements to help support his urinary tract health.\n",

            "Lastly, while UTIs are uncommonly transmitted between dogs and humans, it\\'s always a good idea to practice good hygiene. Remember to wash your hands thoroughly after handling your dog or cleaning up any accidents. If you have any concerns about your own health or suspect any symptoms, it\\'s best to consult with your doctor.\n",
